# 🖐️ Hand Tracking Project

This project is a real-time gesture recognition system that uses hand tracking to enable interactive applications like a Virtual Mouse, Math Solver, ASL (American Sign Language) Recognition, and Handwriting Recognition. It is built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✋ **Virtual Mouse:** Control your mouse using hand gestures.
- ➕ **Math Mode:** Perform simple math operations with gestures.
- 🤟 **ASL Recognition:** Detect and interpret American Sign Language alphabets.
- ✍️ **Handwriting Recognition:** Simulates writing and recognizes handwritten characters using tracked hand motion.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure your webcam is connected and functioning.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

Then select a mode:
```
1. Virtual Mouse
2. Math Mode
3. ASL Recognition
4. Handwriting Recognition
```

Each mode will run its corresponding module inside the `modules/` directory.
